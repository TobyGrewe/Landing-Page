      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a recent IT graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Information
        Technology . My journey in technology has been driven by curiosity and a
        passion for problem-solving.
      </p>

      <h2>Education & Certifications</h2>
      <p>
        Throughout my studies, I've built a strong foundation in IT
        fundamentals, networking, security, cloud computing, and web
        development. I've earned multiple industry certifications including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>CompTIA A+, Network+, Security+, Project+</strong></li>
        <li><strong>AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner</strong></li>
        <li><strong>ITIL Foundation</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Linux Foundations</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These certifications complement my academic coursework in data
        management, web development, user interface design, and cloud
        technologies.
      </p>

      <h2>Current Focus</h2>
      <p>
        While my background spans the full IT spectrum, I've discovered a
        particular passion for web development. I'm currently deepening my
        skills in full-stack development through The Odin Project, focusing on
        HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern development workflows.
      </p>

      <h2>What Drives Me</h2>
      <p>
        I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and creating user-friendly
        experiences. My broad IT foundation—from networking and security to
        cloud infrastructure—gives me a unique perspective on web development,
        allowing me to build solutions that are not only functional and
        beautiful, but also secure and scalable.
      </p>

      <h2>Let's Connect</h2>
      <p>
        I'm actively seeking opportunities to contribute to meaningful projects
        and continue growing as a developer. Feel free to check out my
        <a href="projects.html">projects</a> or connect with me on
        <a href="https://github.com/TobyGrewe" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and
        <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/tobygrewe" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a
        >.
      </p>
      <h2>Beyond the Code</h2>
      <p>
        When I'm not coding, I enjoy a diverse range of interests that keep me
        inspired and balanced. I'm passionate about photography, always looking
        for the perfect shot, and I love getting lost in a good book or film.
        Music is a constant companion in my daily life, and I find joy in
        learning
